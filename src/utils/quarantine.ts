/**
 * Conversion quarantine: helpers that let a conversion write into a
 * scratch directory and atomically promote the result(s) to the live
 * `chartPath`. A Signal K crash during conversion leaves a stale dir
 * inside `<dataDir>/in-progress/`; `sweepStaleQuarantineDirs()` wipes
 * any leftover at startup so the user's chart library is never
 * polluted with half-built `.mbtiles` files.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * - One subdir per chart number (`<dataDir>/in-progress/<chartNumber>/`).
 *   Multiple concurrent conversions of the same chartNumber can't
 *   collide because `cpuBudget.maxConcurrentConversions` is 1, but the
 *   subdir layout still keeps things tidy under inspection.
 *
 * - `promote()` uses `fs.promises.rename` first (atomic when both
 *   sides are on the same filesystem) and falls back to copy+unlink
 *   when the user has set `chartPath` to a different mount (USB/NFS).
 *
 * - The promotion target dir (subfolder under chartPath) is created
 *   recursively; the converter itself doesn't need to know how the
 *   final landing location is shaped.

/**
 * Promote every file the converter produced from the quarantine
 * dir into `targetDir` (subfolder under chartPath). Failure is
 * **all-or-nothing**: if any file fails to move, every file that
 * was already moved this call is rolled back to the quarantine and
 * any pre-existing live file we displaced is restored. Without that,
 * a multi-file RNC/Pilot batch could end up half-promoted — a
 * partial chart set in chartPath defeats the quarantine guarantee.
 *
 * Pre-existing files in `targetDir` whose names collide with a
 * promoted filename are preserved by moving the original aside to a
 * sibling `<filename>.replaced-<ts>` first; on success those backups
 * are removed, on failure they're moved back into place. Without
 * this step, a failed multi-file promotion could leave the user's
 * previously working chart deleted with no replacement (the new file
 * was rolled back to quarantine, but the old file we overwrote en
 * route is gone).
 *
 * Each `filename` must be a plain basename (no `..`, no separators,
 * not absolute). The helper is the trust boundary between converter
 * output and the live chart directory; a converter that returns
 * `../foo.mbtiles` would otherwise write outside `targetDir`.
