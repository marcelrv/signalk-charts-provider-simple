/**
 * Thin wrapper around `signalk-container`'s `ContainerManagerApi.runJob`
 * that hides the path-translation, image-pull, and result-shape boilerplate
 * the converter modules used to do directly via `container-runtime.ts`.
 *
 * The wrapper exists because every converter call site shares the same
 * shape:
 *   1. Resolve absolute host paths to (source, subPath) pairs that the
 *      runtime can mount, regardless of how SignalK is deployed.
 *   2. Mount each input read-only at a conventional container path like
 *      `/input`, output RW at `/output`.
 *   3. Run the helper container, line-by-line stdout/stderr capture.
 *   4. Return `{ exitCode }` so converter logic can branch on it.
 *
 * `resolveJobPaths` and `runJobWithBinds` keep that shape uniform across
 * the s57-converter / rnc-converter sites and isolate the integration
 * with signalk-container in one place — if the runtime API evolves, only
 * this file changes.
