# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Per project convention: `npm run format` → `npm run build` → `npm run test`.

- `npm run build` — `tsc` to `dist/` (sources in `src/**/*.ts`, target ES2022, CommonJS, strict)
- `npm run build:watch` — incremental compile
- `npm run test` — runs `pretest` (build + regenerate `test/fixtures/test-chart.mbtiles`) then `node --test --test-force-exit test/**/*.test.js`
- Run a single test file: `npm run build && node --test --test-force-exit test/s57-converter.test.js`
- Run a single test by name: append `--test-name-pattern "<regex>"` to the node command
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint (typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked` for `src/**/*.ts`; plain JS rules for `test/**/*.js`)
- `npm run format` — Prettier on `src/**/*.ts` + `test/**/*.js`, then `eslint --fix`
- `npm run format:check` — non-mutating CI check

Node ≥ 22.5 is required: the plugin reads MBTiles via the built-in `node:sqlite` module (no native compile). The `pretest` step regenerates the MBTiles test fixture; if a test reports "fixture missing", run `npm run test:fixtures`.

## Architecture

This is a Signal K server plugin. The single entry is `src/index.ts`, which exports a `pluginConstructor(app)` factory returning the `Plugin` object Signal K calls (`start` / `stop` / `schema` / `registerWithRouter`). Built output lands in `dist/` and is what npm publishes alongside `assets/`, `public/`, and `docs/screenshots/`.

### Two responsibilities, one plugin

1. **Serve charts to Signal K** (display path, no container runtime needed).
   - `charts-loader.ts` walks the configured `chartPath` recursively and produces a `Record<string, ChartProvider>` keyed by identifier. It handles both `.mbtiles` files and tilemap directories (with `tilemapresource.xml`).
   - `utils/mbtiles-reader.ts` opens MBTiles via `node:sqlite`. `utils/mbtiles-metadata.ts` reads/writes the `metadata` table (used for chart rename, which marks tiles "USER MODIFIED").
   - `ChartProvider` exposes both `v1` and `v2` shapes (see `src/types.ts`) so the plugin works on Signal K v1 and v2 servers; `serverMajorVersion` is sniffed from `app.config.version`.
   - `utils/chart-state.ts` persists per-chart enable/disable in the plugin data dir; `utils/file-scanner.ts` enumerates folders for the management UI.

2. **Convert charts on demand** (write path, requires Docker/Podman via the `signalk-container` plugin — see the integration section below for the API contract).
   - `utils/container-manager.ts` is the discovery + waiting layer for the `signalk-container` plugin's manager API. Converters call `getContainerManager()` after `start()` has resolved it; they never import `dockerode` directly.
   - `utils/s57-converter.ts` runs GDAL → tippecanoe pipelines for S-57 ENC, GSHHG, and SHP basemaps. `utils/s57-band.ts` sorts S-57 cells by chart-band and feeds tippecanoe per-band layers.
   - `utils/rnc-converter.ts` runs GDAL pipelines for BSB/KAP raster (`processRncZip`) and Pilot tarballs (`processPilotTar`).
   - `utils/concurrency.ts` is the **single source of truth for CPU usage**. The plugin config exposes a `cpuBudget` enum (`single-core` / `half` / `all`); `setCpuBudget` is called from `start()` and `getCpuBudget()` returns the live `{ maxConcurrentConversions, tippecanoeThreadsPerJob, gdalExportParallelism }` so converters pick up changes between jobs without a restart. Don't reimplement CPU/concurrency logic elsewhere — read it from this module.
   - `utils/catalog-manager.ts` fetches and caches catalogs from `chartcatalogs.github.io` and tracks installed catalog charts so update notifications can fire.
   - `utils/download-manager.ts` is a queue with progress for direct-URL downloads and ZIP extraction.

### `signalk-container` integration

From 2.0 onward, every container-runtime call (image pulls, helper-job execution, mount resolution, orphan cleanup) goes through the `signalk-container` plugin instead of `dockerode`. `utils/container-manager.ts` is a thin shim:

- Defines a local `ContainerManagerApi` type that is a **subset** of `signalk-container`'s published API — only the methods chart-provider calls (`runJob`, `resolveSignalkDataMount`, `resolveHostPath`, `cleanupOrphanedJobs`, `getRuntime`, `pullImage`, `imageExists`, plus the optional `whenReady`). We don't `import` from `signalk-container` because it's a peer plugin (loaded by Signal K, not bundled), so the shim is the API contract we depend on.
- `waitForContainerManager()` discovers the manager on `(globalThis as any).__signalk_containerManager`. Plugin load order is non-deterministic, so it polls up to 30 s.
  - **signalk-container >= 1.6.0**: uses `manager.whenReady()` — a single await that resolves when runtime detection has settled. Faster than polling and avoids busy-checking `getRuntime()` every second.
  - **signalk-container < 1.6.0**: falls back to the original `while (!getRuntime()) await sleep` loop. The `whenReady?():` declaration is intentionally optional so older versions keep working.
  - Contract: `waitForContainerManager()` never rejects. `whenReady()` rejections are swallowed and treated as "detection didn't settle in time". The caller's job is to handle a `null` return by surfacing `setPluginError`, not to handle thrown errors.

If `signalk-container` is missing, the plugin still loads and **serves charts** (display path needs no runtime); only the convert path is disabled, with `setPluginError` pointing the user at the App Store.

### Hot-apply config and the path marker

`start()` is called fresh on every config save (Signal K restarts the plugin, not the whole server). `utils/path-marker.ts` writes `.charts-provider-marker.json` into the chart path on each start, recording plugin version, container hints, and effective UID — useful when diagnosing host-vs-container path mismatches.

### Web UI

`public/` is a static webapp served by Signal K at `/plugins/signalk-charts-provider-simple/`. It talks to Express routes registered in `index.ts` via `registerWithRouter`. The UI has four tabs: Manage Charts / Download from URL / Convert / Chart Catalog.

### Type extensions

`@signalk/server-api`'s `ServerAPI` type is missing `app.config` and Express route helpers that the real server provides; `src/types.ts` defines `ExtendedServerAPI` for those. When adding new server-API uses, extend that interface rather than casting.

### Tests

Plain Node test runner in `test/*.test.js` (CommonJS, no TS). Tests target the **built** files in `dist/`, which is why `pretest` runs `tsc` first. `test/integration.test.js` exercises the loader against `test/fixtures/test-chart.mbtiles` (regenerated by `test/fixtures/create-test-mbtiles.js`).

## Code conventions

- TypeScript strict mode + `strictTypeChecked` lints. `eqeqeq`, `curly: all`, `no-var`, `prefer-const` are enforced; `no-console` is intentionally off (the plugin logs through `console`).
- Prettier is wired through ESLint, so `prettier/prettier` violations fail lint.
